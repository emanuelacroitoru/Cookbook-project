            Cuisines play an integral part in defining a nation's culture.

            A great international cookbook offers more than just a recipe collection. It should tell you about the history of a cuisine and answer many kinds of questions about the food of a country.
        <br>
            For example, is the dish strongly associated with a particular part of a country, like risotto in northern Italy or mole in Oaxaca, Mexico?

            A good international cookbook should help you understand how a dish may have changed over time. 
            <br>
            A good example is gazpacho, the Spanish cold soup. The most common way it is made now is with tomatoes, but there were no tomatoes in Spain before the sixteenth century and the soup was originally made with bread or almonds and other fresh vegetables.
