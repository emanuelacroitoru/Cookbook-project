      />
      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>½ cup long grain rice (uncooked)</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground pork</li>
        <li>¼ cup parsley (chopped)</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh dill (chopped)</li>
        <li>salt and pepper ( to taste)</li>
        <li>1 head sour cabbage (about 1 large cabbage)</li>
        <li>15 slices bacon (chopped)</li>
        <li>4 cups tomato juice</li>
        <li>water (as needed)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <p>
        1. Soak the sour cabbage in cold water overnight or at least an hour before making these. If you don't have time, rinse the cabbage well under cold water. Then take each leaf and cut the core from then cut it in half if the leaves are too big.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Heat the oil in a skillet, add the onions and cook until softened and translucent. Add the rice and cook for another minute. 
      </p>
      <p>
        3. In a large bowl, add the ground pork, salt, pepper, parsley, dill and the onion and rice mixture. Be careful with the salt, not too much is needed because the sour cabbage is already salty. Mix well using your clean hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Preheat the oven to 375°F (191°C).
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Fill each leaf with about a ¼ cup of the meat mixture and roll tucking in the ends as you see in the video. Repeat with all the remaining meat and cabbage leaves.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. If you have any leftover cabbage leaves you'll want to chop that up and spread some on the bottom of a large Dutch oven. Then place the cabbage rolls on the chopped cabbage in a single layer. Next, you'll want to top with bacon, and be generous.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Finish with another layer of cabbage rolls, more bacon and a bit more chopped cabbage. If you like you can also season with some ground pepper.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. Pour the tomato juice over the cabbage rolls and add additional water as needed. You want to make sure the rolls are completely covered with liquid.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. Cover the Dutch oven with a lid or aluminum foil if your pot doesn't have a lid and transfer it to the oven. Bake for 2 hours, then remove the lid or foil and cook for another 1 to 1.5 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. Serve with polenta and sour cream.
